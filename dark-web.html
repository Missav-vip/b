    <h2>What is the Dark Web?</h2>
    <p>The Dark Web is the most hidden and secretive part of the internet. It is intentionally obscured and requires special software like Tor or I2P for access. It is infamous for hosting illegal activities, such as black markets and illegal content.</p>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <ul>
                <li>Provides complete anonymity for users.</li>
        <li>Offers a space for individuals in oppressive regimes to express themselves without fear of surveillance.</li>
        <li>Allows for encrypted communication and privacy protection in sensitive areas.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Risks</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Heavily associated with illegal activities like hacking, drug trafficking, and illegal pornography.</li>
        <li>Potential exposure to malware, scams, and phishing attacks.</li>
        <li>Requires advanced security measures to protect against law enforcement and malicious actors.</li>
        <li>Visiting certain sites could inadvertently involve users in illegal activities or lead to government surveillance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Dampak (Impact)</h3>
    <p>The Dark Web has a controversial impact. While it provides privacy for whistleblowers, activists, and people in dangerous political environments, it also serves as a hub for criminal activities. Understanding the duality of its nature is essential for responsible use.</p>

    <h3>How to Access</h3>
    <p>Access to the Dark Web requires using special privacy-focused software like the Tor browser, which masks the user's location and encrypts their traffic. However, navigating the Dark Web comes with significant risks, including exposure to illicit content and malicious activity.</p>
