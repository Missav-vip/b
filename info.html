    </header>

    <section id="surfaceweb">
        <h2>1. Surface Web</h2>
        <p>The Surface Web refers to the part of the internet that is accessible to the general public and indexed by search engines such as Google, Bing, and Yahoo. It's the web you interact with on a daily basis through web browsers.</p>
        
        <h3>Key Characteristics:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Publicly accessible without any restrictions or special tools.</li>
            <li>Contains websites that are indexed by search engines and available for anyone to access.</li>
            <li>Examples include social media platforms, news websites, blogs, e-commerce sites, and government pages.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>How it Works:</h3>
        <p>When you type a URL into a browser or use a search engine, the search engine indexes the webpage, and it becomes part of the Surface Web. Websites like Google or Wikipedia fall into this category.</p>

        <h3>Advantages:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Easy access and navigation without any need for special knowledge or tools.</li>
            <li>Widely used by individuals, businesses, and organizations worldwide.</li>
            <li>Supports various web services, such as email, video streaming, e-commerce, and social interaction.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Disadvantages:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Privacy concerns; data collection and surveillance are common.</li>
            <li>Vulnerable to hacking, phishing, and scams.</li>
            <li>Limited anonymity and security when using regular browsers.</li>
        </ul>

    <section id="deepweb">
        <h2>2. Deep Web</h2>
        <p>The Deep Web is the portion of the internet that is not indexed by standard search engines like Google. It consists of private, secure, and personal content that cannot be accessed directly through standard search methods.</p>
        
        <h3>Key Characteristics:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Cannot be found using regular search engines like Google or Bing.</li>
            <li>Includes databases, academic resources, personal email inboxes, subscription services, and more.</li>
            <li>Usually requires special permission or authentication to access.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How it Works:</h3>
        <p>The Deep Web includes things like medical records, academic journals, and financial databases that are not meant to be accessed by the general public. You may need passwords or access codes to view such content.</p>

        <h3>Advantages:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Privacy and anonymity when accessing personal data.</li>
            <li>Access to a vast range of academic, professional, and private resources not indexed by search engines.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Disadvantages:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Not as easy to navigate as the Surface Web.</li>
            <li>Requires tools like VPNs, or specific logins and passwords for many services.</li>
            <li>More difficult to search and access specific data without knowing the exact location.</li>
        </ul>

    <section id="darkweb">
        <h2>3. Dark Web</h2>
        <p>The Dark Web is a hidden part of the Deep Web that is intentionally hidden and accessible only through special software like Tor (The Onion Router). It is known for being a space where both legal and illegal activities occur.</p>

        <h3>Key Characteristics:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Accessed via Tor or similar networks to mask the user's identity and location.</li>
            <li>Contains encrypted websites that end with a ".onion" domain.</li>
            <li>Often used for anonymous communication, marketplaces, and forums.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How it Works:</h3>
        <p>Websites on the Dark Web are not indexed by traditional search engines. They require the Tor browser to access them. The network routes traffic through multiple layers of encryption, which makes it difficult to trace the user's activity.</p>

        <h3>Advantages:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>High level of anonymity and privacy for users.</li>
            <li>Ability to access restricted content and forums without revealing personal identity.</li>
            <li>Enables secure communication for journalists, activists, and others who need privacy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Disadvantages:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Common place for illegal activities, such as illicit markets and illegal services.</li>
            <li>Requires specialized software and technical knowledge to use safely.</li>
            <li>Potential for encountering scams, malware, and malicious content.</li>
        </ul>

    <section id="darknet">
        <h2>4. Darknet</h2>
        <p>The Darknet is a network of websites that use specific protocols or encryption techniques that aren't accessible to the general public. It is often used to ensure privacy and anonymity.</p>
        
        <h3>Key Characteristics:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Access requires specific software or configurations like I2P, Tor, or Freenet.</li>
            <li>Contains many hidden services and forums that are not found on the Surface Web or Deep Web.</li>
            <li>Often used for communication in restricted or censored environments.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How it Works:</h3>
        <p>The Darknet uses anonymous communication protocols that ensure the identity of users remains hidden. Software like Tor routes traffic through multiple layers of encryption to prevent anyone from tracking the user’s activity.</p>

        <h3>Advantages:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Complete anonymity and security for users.</li>
            <li>Can host secure services for private communications.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Disadvantages:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>It’s a breeding ground for illegal activities.</li>
            <li>Highly technical setup required to use it properly and safely.</li>
            <li>Potential exposure to illegal content and criminal activity.</li>
        </ul>

    <section id="deepnet">
        <h2>5. Deepnet</h2>
        <p>The Deepnet is a subset of the Deep Web that contains more private, untraceable, and hidden data. It is typically used by security professionals, journalists, and others who need to work in an encrypted environment.</p>

        <h3>Key Characteristics:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Access requires encrypted connections and sometimes special invitations or tools.</li>
            <li>Contains hidden forums, communications, and unlisted databases.</li>
            <li>Often involves more complex or secure access methods compared to the general Deep Web.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How it Works:</h3>
        <p>Accessing the Deepnet requires using highly secure tools that often work in combination with other privacy measures.
                  <h3>How it Works:</h3>
        <p>The Hidden Internet uses encryption techniques and tools that mask users' identities and protect the data shared. It requires highly specialized software and access privileges, making it inaccessible to the general public.</p>

        <h3>Advantages:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Provides ultimate privacy and security for sensitive communications.</li>
            <li>Offers a completely encrypted environment for data sharing.</li>
            <li>Utilized by governments, intelligence agencies, and high-level professionals for secure activities.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Disadvantages:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Extremely difficult to access without specific software and permissions.</li>
            <li>Not accessible to the general public due to its highly secure nature.</li>
            <li>Requires advanced technical knowledge to navigate safely.</li>
        </ul>
