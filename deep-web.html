    <h2>What is the Deep Web?</h2>
    <p>The Deep Web consists of websites and data that are not indexed by standard search engines. These include private databases, password-protected sites, academic research papers, medical records, and more. Unlike the Surface Web, it requires specific credentials or access permissions to browse.</p>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Access to specialized, often sensitive, information.</li>
        <li>More private and secure data storage.</li>
        <li>Academic and research institutions use this space to store papers and findings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Risks</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Requires special access credentials.</li>
        <li>Some content could be outdated or irrelevant.</li>
        <li>Not as easily searchable, which may make it difficult to find specific data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Dampak (Impact)</h3>
    <p>The Deep Web is an essential resource for research, but accessing its data may be restricted or difficult for the average user. Unauthorized access to some information may have legal consequences.</p>

    <h3>How to Access</h3>
    <p>To access the Deep Web, you may need special credentials, such as a login or access to specific networks. It's often accessed through university or enterprise systems.</p>
